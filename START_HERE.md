## What's Inside

### Files You Need to Know

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **sidebar.html** | Trade form (inputs, buttons, preview) |
| **sidebar.js** | Form logic, event handlers, UI state |
| **background.js** | Quote logic, MetaMask routing |
| **content.js** | Bridge to page context |
| **injected.js** | MetaMask communication |

### Documentation

| Doc | Read This For |
|-----|---------------|
| **BUILD_COMPLETE.md** | Overview of what was built |
| **TRADE_TESTING.md** | How to test with MetaMask |
| **TRADE_FEATURE_SUMMARY.md** | Technical architecture details |
| **README.md** | Installation & general usage |
| **CLAUDE.md** | Project design decisions |

## The Architecture (Simple Version)

```
User types in sidebar
        ↓
sidebar.js validates & sends message
        ↓
background.js handles the message
        ↓
content.js forwards to page context
        ↓
injected.js talks to MetaMask
        ↓
MetaMask shows transaction popup
        ↓
User clicks "Confirm"
        ↓
Transaction submitted to Sepolia
        ↓
Success! ✅
```

This design is secure because MetaMask never gives private keys to the extension.

## What Works Right Now

✅ **Tab Switching** - Click between "🔍 Scan" and "💱 Trade"
✅ **Form Inputs** - Type addresses and amounts
✅ **Validation** - Errors if you miss a field
✅ **Mock Quotes** - Returns test data (not real prices yet)
✅ **Preview Display** - Shows gas cost, slippage, price impact
✅ **Error Messages** - Clear text when something goes wrong
✅ **MetaMask Routing** - Connects to wallet properly

## What Still Needs Work

⏳ **Real Prices** - Currently returns mock values (1.5x conversion)
   → Would need: Uniswap SDK or quoter contract call

⏳ **Real Transactions** - Currently returns mock hash
   → Would need: ethers.js to build calldata and send via MetaMask

⏳ **Token Approvals** - Not handling ERC20 approvals yet
   → Would need: Check allowance, request approval flow

⏳ **Shortcuts** - Can't use "WETH"/"USDC" text yet
   → Would need: Map common tokens to addresses

## How to Test

### Easy Test (No Wallet Needed)
1. Load extension
2. Click Trade tab
3. Enter the test addresses above
4. Click "Get Quote" → See the preview
5. Click "Execute Swap" → See "no active tab" error (expected!)

### Full Test (Requires MetaMask)
1. Install MetaMask
2. Get test ETH from: https://sepoliafaucet.com/
3. Switch MetaMask to Sepolia testnet
4. Open any webpage
5. Follow "Easy Test" steps 1-4
6. In step 5: MetaMask should popup!

**For detailed test steps**, see: **TRADE_TESTING.md**

## Common Questions

### Q: Why does it say "no active tab found"?
**A:** The extension needs an active webpage to execute swaps. Open google.com or any website first.

### Q: Can I test with real money?
**A:** Only testnet! Sepolia uses fake ETH. Get free test ETH from the faucet.

### Q: How do I see if my transaction worked?
**A:** Look at the success message - it has a link to Sepolia Etherscan. Click it!

### Q: Can I use mainnet?
**A:** Not yet. Current implementation is Sepolia-only for safety. Adding mainnet requires user warnings.

### Q: What if the quote doesn't look right?
**A:** Quotes are currently mocked for testing. Real prices would come from Uniswap.
