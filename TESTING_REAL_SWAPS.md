## Prerequisites

### 1. MetaMask Setup
```
✅ MetaMask installed
✅ Set to Sepolia testnet
✅ Have some Sepolia ETH (from faucet)
```

### 2. Get Sepolia Test ETH
```
1. Go to: https://sepoliafaucet.com/
2. Connect with MetaMask
3. Get test ETH (free)
4. Wait a few seconds for it to arrive
```

### 3. Reload the Extension
```
1. Go to: chrome://extensions/
2. Find "SynthX - Web3 Intelligence"
3. Click the refresh icon 🔄
4. This loads the latest code with fixes
```

---

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Open Uniswap in Browser
```
1. Open a new browser tab
2. Go to: https://app.uniswap.org/swap
3. Make sure MetaMask shows "Sepolia" network
4. MetaMask should show your test ETH balance
```

### Step 2: Open SynthX Extension
```
1. Click SynthX icon in top-right
2. Should see the sidebar popup
3. Go to "💱 Trade" tab
```

### Step 3: Try Natural Language Input
```
In the "Command" input box, type:
"Swap 0.001 ETH for USDT"

Then click: "🤖 Parse Command"

Expected result:
- Form fills with: From="ETH", Amount="0.001", To="USDT"
- Message: "✅ Parsed! "ETH" → "USDT" (0.001)"
```

### Step 4: Get Quote
```
After form fills, click: "Get Quote"

You should see:
- Expected Output: "Loading..." → real value
- Min Received: "Loading..." → real value
- Gas Cost: "Estimating..." → real estimate
- AI recommendations

⚠️ Note: Quote shows "🔄 Getting real quote..."
because real quote happens during execution
```

### Step 5: Execute Swap
```
Click: "Execute Swap"

Console should show:
[Content] Message from background: executeSwapViaMetaMask
[Injected] Starting swap execution
[Injected] Wallet address: 0x...
[Injected] Checking token approval...
```

### Step 6: Confirm MetaMask Popups
```
You'll see MetaMask popup(s):

Popup 1 (if needed): "Approve USDT"
- This is the ERC20 approval
- Click "Approve"

Popup 2: "Confirm Swap"
- This is the actual swap
- Click "Confirm"

Wait a few seconds...
```

### Step 7: See Result
```
You should see in SynthX:
✅ Swap submitted! Transaction: 0x...
💡 Link to view on Sepolia Etherscan

Console shows:
[Injected] Transaction hash: 0x...
[Injected] Quote received: {...}
```

## What to Look For in Console Logs

### Success Path
```
[Content] SynthX content script loaded on page: https://app.uniswap.org/swap
[Content] Starting script injection...
[Content] ethers.js loaded successfully
[Content] Uniswap helper loaded successfully

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Still Getting "Could not establish connection"

**Fixes to try (in order):**

1. **Reload extension**
   ```
   chrome://extensions/
   Click refresh icon on SynthX
   ```

2. **Reload webpage**
   ```
   Press Ctrl+R or Cmd+R on Uniswap tab
   Wait for page to fully load
   Try swap again
   ```

3. **Open new tab**
   ```
   Close current Uniswap tab
   Open new tab
   Go to uniswap.org/swap again
   Try swap again
   ```

4. **Check MetaMask**
   ```
   Make sure MetaMask is:
   - Installed and enabled
   - Set to Sepolia testnet
   - Account is unlocked
   - Has some Sepolia ETH
   ```

### Issue 2: ethers.js Failed to Load
```
Console shows: [Content] Failed to load ethers.js from CDN

Cause: Internet connection or CDN issue
Fix: Try again, may be temporary
```

### Issue 3: Scripts Not Injecting
```
Console doesn't show script load messages

Try:
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Refresh page
4. Look for [Content] messages

If still not showing:
1. Right-click Uniswap page
2. Select "Inspect"
3. Look in Console for errors
4. Take screenshot of errors
```

### Issue 4: MetaMask Popup Doesn't Appear
```
After clicking "Execute Swap":

If no MetaMask popup:
1. Check if MetaMask window is open in background
2. Check if MetaMask is locked
3. Try unlocking MetaMask
4. Try swap again

If MetaMask locked:
1. Click MetaMask icon
2. Unlock with your password
3. Try swap again
```

## Testing Different Swap Pairs

### Pair 1: ETH → USDT (TEST FIRST - Easiest)
```
From: ETH (no approval needed)
To: USDT (any ERC20 token works)
Amount: 0.001 (small, safe)
Expected: 1 MetaMask popup (swap only)
```

### Pair 2: USDT → ETH (TEST SECOND - Needs Approval)
```
From: USDT (needs approval first time)
To: ETH
Amount: 1 (small amount)
Expected: 2 MetaMask popups (approval + swap)
```

### Pair 3: ETH → USDC (Alternative)
```
From: ETH
To: USDC
Amount: 0.001
Note: USDC has 6 decimals (different from USDT)
```

## Viewing Transaction on Etherscan

After swap completes:

1. **In SynthX:** Click the Etherscan link
   ```
   "View on Sepolia Etherscan"
   ```

2. **Or manually:**
   ```
   Go to: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/
   Paste your tx hash in search
   See transaction details
   ```

3. **What to look for:**
   ```
   Status: Success ✅ (or Pending ⏳)
   From: Your wallet address
   To: Uniswap Router (0x3bFA...)
   Input Data: Encoded swap call
   ```

---

## Console Commands (For Debugging)

Open DevTools (F12) and go to Console tab:

```javascript
// Check if UniswapHelper is available
console.log(typeof window.UniswapHelper !== 'undefined')
// Should print: true

// Check ethers.js availability
console.log(typeof ethers !== 'undefined')
// Should print: true

// Get wallet address from MetaMask
ethereum.request({method: 'eth_accounts'}).then(accounts => console.log(accounts[0]))
// Should print: 0x...

// Check if on Sepolia
ethereum.request({method: 'eth_chainId'}).then(chainId => console.log(chainId))
// Should print: 0xaa36a7 (which is Sepolia)
```

## Next Steps After Successful Test

Once you get one swap working:

1. **Try different amounts**
   ```
   0.001 ETH
   0.005 ETH
   0.01 ETH
   ```

2. **Try approval flow**
   ```
   Swap USDT → ETH
   See approval popup first
   Then swap popup
   ```

3. **Try different tokens**
   ```
   If USDT doesn't exist on Sepolia:
   Use USDC instead (0x1c7D4B...)
   Or other ERC20 tokens
   ```

4. **Test AI features**
   ```
   Try different command phrases:
   "Swap 0.001 ETH for USDC"
   "Trade 5 USDC to WETH"
   "Exchange 0.001 ETH for USDT"
   ```

---

## If Everything Fails

**Last resort debugging:**

1. **Check browser console** (F12)
   ```
   Look for any red error messages
   Note the exact error
   ```

2. **Check extension console**
   ```
   chrome://extensions/
   Find SynthX
   Click "inspect service worker"
   Look for errors in console
   ```

3. **Take a screenshot**
   ```
   Screenshot of:
   1. Browser console errors
   2. Extension console errors
   3. MetaMask network setting
   4. SynthX sidebar showing error
   ```

4. **Try simplest test**
   ```
   Command: "Swap 0.001 ETH for USDC"
   Amount: Smallest possible
   Network: Make sure it's Sepolia
   ```
