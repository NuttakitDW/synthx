# 🗺️ SynthX Blockscout MCP Roadmap

## Current State (v1.0.0)

**What Works:**
- ✅ Address Scanner (tokens/wallets)
- ✅ Safety Score (AI analysis + Blockscout data)
- ✅ Blockscout API integration
- ✅ Claude AI analysis
- ✅ Clean, focused UI

**What Was Removed:**
- ❌ Swap execution (unreliable)
- ❌ Trade features (complex architecture)
- ❌ Web3 signing (message passing hell)

---

## Why This Approach is Better

### Problem We Solved
- **Before:** Trying to execute swaps via browser extension (fragile, broke constantly)
- **After:** Analyze blockchain data reliably (always works)

### What Users Actually Need
1. **Understand tokens before buying** ← We do this ✅
2. **Analyze wallets and addresses** ← We can do this ✅
3. **Find scams/honeypots** ← We can do this ✅
4. **See transaction details** ← We can do this ✅
5. **Execute swaps** ← Use Uniswap directly (no need to duplicate)

---

## Feature Roadmap

### Phase 1: Enhanced Scanner (Next - Easy)

**Current:**
```
Input: Address
Process: Blockscout query + Claude analysis
Output: Safety score
```

**Expand to:**
- Token contract details (total supply, decimals, owner)
- Holder distribution (is it concentrated?)
- Recent transaction activity
- Verified/unverified status
- Associated websites/links

**Implementation:**
- More Blockscout API calls
- Enhanced Claude prompt
- Better UI display

**Effort:** 2-3 hours

---

### Phase 2: Portfolio Dashboard (Medium)

**Feature:**
```
User Input: Wallet address
Output:
  - All tokens held
  - Current value
  - Recent transactions
  - NFTs owned
  - DeFi positions (if any)
```

**Implementation:**
- `getAddressInfo()` → Wallet balance
- `getTokensByAddress()` → Token holdings
- `nftTokensByAddress()` → NFTs
- Calculate portfolio value
- Show transaction history

**Why it's valuable:**
- Users can see their portfolio at a glance
- Easy scam detection (see if you got honeypotted)
- See where your money is

**Effort:** 4-5 hours

---

### Phase 3: Transaction Analyzer (Medium)

**Feature:**
```
User Input: Transaction hash
Output:
  - What happened
  - Token transfers
  - Contract interactions
  - Gas cost
  - Status
```

**Example:**
```
Input: 0xabcd1234...
Output:
  Swap 1.5 USDC for 0.0005 ETH
  Via Uniswap V3
  Gas: 0.003 ETH
  Status: Success ✅
```

**Implementation:**
- `getTransactionInfo()` → Full tx details
- `getTransactionLogs()` → Decoded events
- Claude AI to explain in plain English
- Parse token transfers and swaps

**Why it's valuable:**
- Users understand what they're doing
- Detect failed transactions
- Learn from transaction history

**Effort:** 3-4 hours

---

### Phase 4: Scam Detector (Hard)

**Feature:**
```
Input: Token address
Analysis:
  - Honeypot check (can you sell?)
  - Rug pull risk (liquidity locked?)
  - Whale concentration
  - Contract analysis
  - Known scam lists
Output: Risk score + warnings
```

**Implementation:**
- Holder distribution analysis
- Liquidity position check
- Contract code analysis (if verified)
- Cross-reference scam databases
- Claude AI to assess risk

**Why it's valuable:**
- Prevent scams and rug pulls
- Very unique feature (not available elsewhere)
- High user engagement

**Effort:** 6-8 hours

---

### Phase 5: Market Analyzer (Hard)

**Feature:**
```
Input: Token address
Analysis:
  - Price history (if available)
  - Holder count over time
  - Trading volume
  - Recent activity spike?
  - Twitter mentions?
```

**Implementation:**
- Blockscout transaction history
- Holder count trends
- Volume calculations
- Timeline of activity

**Why it's valuable:**
- Detect pump and dumps
- See if tokens are growing
- Identify emerging opportunities

**Effort:** 6-8 hours

---

## What NOT to Build

### ❌ Swap Execution
- Users have Uniswap (optimized for this)
- Browser extension is wrong architecture
- Too much complexity for marginal benefit

### ❌ Price Feeds
- Other apps do this better
- Real-time pricing is complex
- Blockscout doesn't provide this

### ❌ Custom Routing
- Aggregators exist (1inch, Paraswap)
- Uniswap handles this
- Not our competitive advantage
