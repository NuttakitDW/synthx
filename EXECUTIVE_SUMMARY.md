## Technical Architecture

### Stack
- **Frontend:** Chrome Extension (Manifest V3)
- **AI:** Claude API (Anthropic)
- **Blockchain:** Blockscout API (public blockchain data)
- **Storage:** Chrome local storage (encrypted, synced)

### Why This Stack
```
Chrome Extension (not website):
  ✅ Zero friction (always available)
  ✅ Auto-detect addresses (page context)
  ✅ Right-click integration (native)
  ✅ 24/7 monitoring (background script)
  ✅ Notifications (system integration)

Claude API (not other models):
  ✅ Best reasoning (understand scam patterns)
  ✅ JSON parsing (structured output)
  ✅ Cost-effective
  ✅ Easy to integrate

Blockscout API (not RPC):
  ✅ Always reliable
  ✅ Rich data (holders, transfers, verification)
  ✅ No rate limits
  ✅ Public blockchain only (safe)
```

### How It Works
```
User → Right-click address on ANY website
   ↓
Extension detects address
   ↓
Calls Blockscout API
   ├→ Get holder distribution
   ├→ Get verification status
   ├→ Get transaction history
   └→ Get owner info
   ↓
Sends to Claude AI
   ├→ Analyze for red flags
   ├→ Compare to known patterns
   ├→ Calculate risk score
   └→ Generate verdict
   ↓
Shows result in sidebar: 🔴 SCAM / 🟡 RISKY / 🟢 SAFE
   ↓
User makes informed decision
```

## Go-To-Market Strategy

### Phase 1: Hackathon (This Week)
```
Target: Win competition
Approach: Show context awareness demo
Goal: Validation + social proof
Outcome: Judges think "I want this"
```

### Phase 2: Beta (Weeks 2-3)
```
Target: 100 beta testers
Approach: Discord, Twitter, crypto communities
Goal: Feedback + refinement
Outcome: Real user feedback
```

### Phase 3: Chrome Web Store (Week 4)
```
Target: Launch publicly
Approach: 1-click install
Goal: 10,000+ users in 3 months
Outcome: Viral growth through word-of-mouth
```

### Phase 4: Monetization (Month 2+)
```

## Financials (Realistic Projection)

### Development Cost
- Initial build: 30-40 hours developer time
- Maintenance: 5 hours/week ongoing
- Total first 6 months: ~200 hours

### Revenue Potential (Month 6+)
```
Assumptions:
- 10,000 users (achievable)
- 5% convert to Pro tier ($4.99/month)
- 500 paying customers

Revenue: 500 × $4.99 = $2,495/month
Annual: $29,940

This covers:
- 1 full-time developer working part-time
- API costs
- Infrastructure
```

### Alternative: Enterprise Revenue
```
If projects use for token safety:
- Custom integration: $5,000-$10,000
- White-label: $20,000-$50,000
- API access: $1,000/month

Total potential: Much higher
```

## Risk Assessment

### What Could Go Wrong

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Claude API outage | ❌ Can't analyze | Fallback to basic checks |
| Blockscout API changes | 🟡 Limited data | Keep backup endpoints |
| User expectations too high | 🟡 Bad reviews | Manage expectations in UI |
| Chrome policy changes | 🟡 Rejection | Stay policy-compliant |
| False positives | 🔴 User loses trust | Improve Claude prompt |

### How to Mitigate
- **API reliability:** Multiple data sources, caching
- **Accuracy:** Continuous refinement of Claude prompt
- **Trust:** Transparent about confidence levels
- **Compliance:** Read-only, no signing, no wallet access

## One Final Truth

**Most crypto tools fail because they add friction.**

SynthX succeeds because it **removes friction.**

```
Friction approach:
Navigate → Website → Search → Read → Analyze → Decide → Buy
(7 steps, 30 seconds, user leaves their flow)

SynthX approach:
Right-click → Result
(2 steps, 1 second, never leave your flow)
```

**This is why the extension format matters.**

---

## Conclusion

**SynthX is:**
- ✅ A real solution to a real problem
- ✅ Something people will actually use
- ✅ Something that can grow into a business
- ✅ Something that can be built this week
- ✅ Something that could prevent millions in losses

**The decision:** Do you want to build a hackathon project, or do you want to build a real product?

**The answer:** Start with the hackathon (4 hours), then build the real product (30 hours), then watch it grow.

**The timeline:** Realistically, you could have a Chrome Web Store-ready product in 2-3 weeks.

**The payoff:** A product that could genuinely help people and make money.
